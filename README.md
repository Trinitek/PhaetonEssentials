<h1>PhaetonEssentials</h1>
<h3>An Essentials-like Bukkit plugin specifically designed for the Phaeton Minecraft server.</h3>
<hr>
The purpose of this plugin is to provide an all-in-one plugin tailored to the Phaeton Minecraft server. It aims to implement a limited set of commands found in other Essentials plugins, along with rudimentary region protection and advanced administrative functionality with the help of the CoreProtect and PermissionsEX APIs.

Powerful administrative commands is a main goal with this project, where it tries to offer indepth data and analytics pertaining to each player, in order to better help the surveillance power of the server moderators to target problematic players and griefers quickly and more efficiently.
